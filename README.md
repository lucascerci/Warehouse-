# Warehouse-

I did this project in college, it consists of software in java that shows:

 >The quantity of beers (can be anything) in the store
 
 >Total number of crates in the warehouse
 
 >Calculate the ideal of boxes in each warehouse
 
 >Which magazine has more and which has fewer beers
 
 >Informs how many beers in the indicated compartment
 
 >Order the beers
 
 >Shows the percentage of the number of boxes that have more boxes than the average
 
 >Shows what's next on specific shelves
